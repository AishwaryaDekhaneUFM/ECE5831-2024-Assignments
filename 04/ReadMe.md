# README for HW4: MultiLayerPerceptron Implementation

## Assignment Description
This homework involves the implementation of a MultiLayerPerceptron class. The goal is to create a neural network class based on the work we did in class. You are required to write both a script and a Jupyter notebook for testing and validating your implementation.

### Files to Submit
- multilayer_perceptron.py: This file contains the implementation of the `MultiLayerPerceptron` class.
- module4.py: This Python script tests and validates the `MultiLayerPerceptron` class.
- module4.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook mirrors the class activity and includes testing/validation of your class and functions. Make sure to show all your work.

## Instructions for Running the Code
### multilayer_perceptron.py
This file contains the core implementation of the MultiLayerPerceptron class. You can import and use this class in other scripts or notebooks for testing and validation.

### module4.py
This script runs tests on the `MultiLayerPerceptron` class. It performs the following tasks:
- Initializes a MultiLayerPerceptron model.
- Trains the model using sample data.
- Tests the model's performance.
- Outputs the validation results.

### module4.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook is designed to demonstrate how to use and test the `MultiLayerPerceptron` class interactively. It follows the examples and practices used during class, including:
- Step-by-step model initialization.
- Training and validation using test datasets.
- Detailed output showing intermediate steps.
